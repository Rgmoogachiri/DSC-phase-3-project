    "As the world struggles to vaccinate the global population against COVID-19, an understanding of how peopleâ€™s backgrounds, opinions, and health behaviors are related to their personal vaccination patterns can provide guidance for future public health efforts. Your audience could be someone guiding those public health efforts.\r\n",

    "This challenge: can you predict whether people got H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines using data collected in the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey? This is a binary classification problem, but there are two potential targets: whether the survey respondent received the seasonal flu vaccine, or whether the respondent received the H1N1 flu vaccine. Please choose just one of these potential targets for your minimum viable project."

    "1. Our objective is to develop a predictive model to identify individuals who are likely to exhibit vaccine hesitancy.our goal is to provide insights that can inform targeted vaccination campaigns and interventions aimed at addressing vaccine hesitancy and increasing vaccine uptake rates.\n",
    "2. identify common factors associated with increased uptake of vaccines. Understanding these factors can inform the development of targeted interventions and public health strategies aimed at promoting vaccination uptake and improving overall immunization rates \n",
    "3. Examine the influence of socio-economic factors, such as income and education, on vaccination decisions"
